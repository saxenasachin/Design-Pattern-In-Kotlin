# What Are Design Patterns ?

Design patterns are a way to solve similar problems in a similar ways. So, basically we are not trying to re-invent the
wheel when we are building an application or a piece of code. What we want is to be able to solve certain problems in a
way that we know is successful and scalable which will allow us not to run into issues down the line. When we co-relate
with the android development, there are a lot of areas where you can implement these practices so that we can make the
app more scalable and robust.

You can think of design patterns as a "Standard Terminology" that the developers uses to make everyday life simpler.
There is a method to this madness, meaning that the team in which you are working can understand the code on the go.

Design-patterns can also give you a little heads up on how to solve a problem using the best practices. This Repository
is based on a book from [Gang of Four](http://wiki.c2.com/?GangOfFour) often referred to as GoF, The Bible, The
Foundation book...etc

This repo is targeted to audiences with any level of knowledge in kotlin. If you have not yet started kotlin, here are
some super useful links to get the learning materials that I personally recommend.

There are mainly three types of design patterns.

#### Creational

This pattern gives us a heads-up on how we create the objects on demand. They provide various object creation
mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

#### Structural

This pattern gives us an idea on how various objects and components in our application relates to each other. This also
explains how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and
efficient. This can also help you achieve some good objectives like separation-of-concerns, scalability,
testability...etc.

#### Behavioural Pattern

This pattern gives more emphasis on how an object function inside your code. They are more concerned with algorithms and
the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
