# What Are Design Patterns ?

Design patterns are a way to solve similar problems in a similar ways. So, basically we are not trying to re-invent the
wheel when we are building an application or a piece of code. What we want is to be able to solve certain problems in a
way that we know is successful and scalable which will allow us not to run into issues down the line. When we co-relate
with the android development, there are a lot of areas where you can implement these practices so that we can make the
app more scalable and robust.

You can think of design patterns as a "Standard Terminology" that the developers uses to make everyday life simpler.
There is a method to this madness, meaning that the team in which you are working can understand the code on the go.

Design-patterns can also give you a little heads up on how to solve a problem using the best practices. This Repository
is based on a book from [Gang of Four](http://wiki.c2.com/?GangOfFour) often referred to as GoF, The Bible, The
Foundation book...etc

This repo is targeted to audiences with any level of knowledge in kotlin. If you have not yet started kotlin, here are
some super useful links to get the learning materials that I personally recommend.
